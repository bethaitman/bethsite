## What I read in 2019

1. **Born A Crime**, Trevor Noah
+ **The Secret Barrister** *(started)*
+ **Night Watch**, Terry Pratchett *(repeat)*
<br> *Pratchett really knows how to write, and to build a plot. Very different to the other Discworld books.*
+ **The Elements of Style**, Strunk and White
+ **This Means This, This Means That: A User's Guide to Semiotics**, Sean Hall
+ **Murder at the Vicarage**, Agatha Christie
+ **The City and The City**, China Mieville *(repeat)*
<br> *I hadn't read it in years, and the central conceit still holds up well. Well-constructed.*
+ **So Good They Can’t Ignore You**, Cal Newport
+ **A Voyage for Madmen**, Peter Nichols
+ **Mary Queen of Scots**, Antonia Fraser *(started)*
+ **Nudge**, Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler *(started)*
+ **Empire Games and the Bloodline Feud**, Charles Stross
+ **The Bedlam Stacks**, Natasha Pulley
<br> *A very odd book, not as good as Filigree Street. Hard to understand what was happening until the very end - rather dream-like, really.*
+ **Ogilvy On Advertising**, David Ogilvy
+ **Penhallow among passing things**, Iona Sharma
+ **The Firm**, John Grisham
+ **The Warrior’s Apprentice**, Lois McMaster Bujold *(repeat)*
<br> *I always find myself coming back to the Miles books.*

<br> *I love the writing in this book. Fabulous scientific history told like a story, with clear engaging prose on a complex topic.*
+ **The Skills**, Mishal Husain
+ **Unspeakable Things**, Laurie Penny
+ **Travesties**, Tom Stoppard
+ **The Watchmaker of Filigree Street**, Natasha Pulley
<br> *One of my favourite fiction books this year. Stunning.*

## What I watched in 2019

Film:

1. **In Bruges**

<br> *Favourite film of the year. Great storytelling, great central character.*
+ **Beauty and the Beast**

+ **Colette**

TV: 

1. **Stranger Things series 1**
+ **Good Omens**
+ **Black Mirror**
<br> *Finally started watching a few years too late. As good and as grim as everyone said it would be.*
