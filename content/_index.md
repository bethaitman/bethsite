# About me

Technical and UX writer. Ex-[Redgate Software](http://www.red-gate.com/), [Ocado Technology](http://www.ocadotechnology.com/), [Improbable](https://improbable.io), [Digital Asset](http://digitalasset.com).

I like working where words meet user experience, and on designing content, not just writing it. I also dabble in web development, interaction design, and user research.

I'm the editor of the monthly [Write the Docs newsletter](http://www.writethedocs.org/newsletter/). I also co-hosted the Welcome Wagon for first-time attendees of [Write the Docs Prague](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/) in 2018, and will be returning to help out with [Write the Docs Prague 2019](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2019/).

Sometimes I give [talks at conferences and meetups]({{< relref "/talks" >}}).
