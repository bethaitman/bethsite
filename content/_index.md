# About me

I'm a technical writer turned product manager. Now at Google; ex-[Redgate Software](http://www.red-gate.com/), [Ocado Technology](http://www.ocadotechnology.com/), [Improbable](https://improbable.io), [Digital Asset](http://digitalasset.com). I grew up in London, and now live in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. [More about my work experience]({{< relref "pages/cv" >}}).

I like working in difficult technical spaces, figuring out how to make infrastructure useful and useable. I've dabbled in interaction design, user research, and web development. I'm happiest when I'm learning something new.

I was previously the editor of the monthly [Write the Docs newsletter](http://www.writethedocs.org/newsletter/), and co-hosted the Welcome Wagon for first-time attendees of [Write the Docs Prague](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/).

Sometimes I give [talks at conferences and meetups]({{< relref "pages/talks" >}}).
