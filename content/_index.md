# About me

Technical and UX writer. Now at Google; ex-[Redgate Software](http://www.red-gate.com/), [Ocado Technology](http://www.ocadotechnology.com/), [Improbable](https://improbable.io), [Digital Asset](http://digitalasset.com). I live in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.

I like working where words meet user experience, and on designing content, not just writing it. I've also dabbled in interaction design, user research, and web development.

I'm the editor of the monthly [Write the Docs newsletter](http://www.writethedocs.org/newsletter/). I also co-hosted the Welcome Wagon for first-time attendees of Write the Docs Prague in [2018](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/) and [2019](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2019/).

Sometimes I give [talks at conferences and meetups]({{< relref "/talks" >}}).
