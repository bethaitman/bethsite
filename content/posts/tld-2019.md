If you're interested in learning more about writing good documentation, there are tons of useful things you can read next! In particular, there's a ton of useful stuff on the [Write the Docs website](https://www.writethedocs.org/), including [videos](https://www.writethedocs.org/videos/) and the [archive of the newsletter](https://www.writethedocs.org/newsletter/#index-of-newsletter-topics).

## 1. Start with what the reader needs

- This is a really fundamental principle that I learned a lot about from [GDS](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/), and specifically from the work that [Sarah Richards]() and others did on content design there. [Some](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/user-needs) [useful](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/tag/user-needs/) [content](https://contentdesign.london/content-design/writing-for-the-user/) from them.

## 2. Write less

- [Minimalism in documentation](https://www.knowledgeowl.com/home/minimalism-documentation)
- [Adopting minimalism in your docs](https://opensource.com/article/17/10/adopting-minimalism-your-docs)

## 3. Write the outline first and 4. Rubber ducking for docs

These are techniques I use but I don't have anything written up about them yet - sorry!

## 5. Write readably

- This section of the talk with a lot more detail, as a blog post: [Editing](https://bethaitman.com/posts/editing)
- An extended version of this talk, focusing on the Haskell ecosystem, is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TD-20Mb_7M).
- [A worked example of editing to make something clearer](https://bethaitman.com/posts/ui-writing/easyjet-cello/)
- Tons of things about readability I learnt, again, from GDS: [GOV.UK content design guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design)
- [Kelly O'Brien on making writing engaging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMdyx4YJ0hQ)

## 6. Fix the problem rather than documenting around it

- [Writing can't fix bad design](https://bethaitman.com/posts/ui-writing/writing-cant-fix-bad-design/)
