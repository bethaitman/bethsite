This has nothing to do with writing.

There's a sweet I like to make around Christmastime. Every year I've come to make it I've mostly forgotten the recipe, so I have to try to find something helpful online, and I can never find one that covers exactly what I need. So I thought I should probably write it down.

Helped along by these two roughly similar recipes: [Orangettes from Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/01/orangettes-recipe-how-to-make-chocolate-orange.html), and [Chocolate-coated grapefruit peel from Sweet by Ottolenghi](http://mapetitekuhinjica.blogspot.com/2017/12/candied-grapefruit-peel-dipped-in-dark.html). But those are both for the peel, rather than slices of the whole fruit.

## Ingredients

- 3 large oranges
- 300g sugar and 300ml water
- 1.5 to 3 tsp Angostura bitters, to taste
- dark or white chocolate

## How to make it

1. Slice the oranges. They need to be pretty thin, so that the peel gets cooked enough to make it not bitter. But too thin will mean they'll collapse while cooking.
2. Boil the orange slices. Most of the recipes have a complicated boil-chill-boil cycle that seems tedious. I tried both that way and just boiling for 2 minutes then cooling in water, and both ways came out fine, so I'd go for the simpler option. Have a large pan of boiling water, and make sure it's boiling for the whole time. You might need to do this in batches.
3. Make the sugar syrup. This is pretty simple: stick the sugar and the water in a large saucepan, and heat until the sugar has dissolved completely. Then add half the bitters.
4. Boil the oranges in sugar. Add all the slices - gently! - to the sugar syrup, and leave them there for 40 minutes to 1h30. You want the syrup to be simmering, not boiling violently.
<br> About 30 minutes in, extract a slice, let it cool, and taste it, to decide whether to add the rest of the bitters.
<br> Top tips for while it's boiling: Don't let it go dry. If it does, add more sugar and water (1g sugar:1ml water) to top it up. Ottelenghis suggests adding a parchment circle on top to keep all the slices submerged, which seems like a great idea.
<br> It's done when... well, when the oranges are no longer bitter, and kind of translucent.
5. Dry the oranges. Carefully extract the slices (they can be a bit delicate at this point) and lay them on a drying sheet or just on some baking paper.
<br> We put them in the hot-but-turned-off oven for a bit to speed up the drying process, but you need to be careful it's not too hot. They will dry out at room temperature, it just takes longer.
6. Dip the slices in chocolate. Really it'd be nicer to have tempered chocolate, but I'm a bit too lazy. I melted 100g of chocolate at a time in a mug, and dipped the slices in so they were half covered, shaking off the excess. Leave them to dry.
