This has nothing to do with writing.

There are these sweets I like to make around Christmas. Every year I forget the recipe I used last year, so I have to try to find something helpful online, and I can never find one that covers exactly what I need. So I thought I should probably write it down.

Helped along by these two roughly similar recipes: [Orangettes from Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/01/orangettes-recipe-how-to-make-chocolate-orange.html), and [Chocolate-coated grapefruit peel from Sweet by Ottolenghi](http://mapetitekuhinjica.blogspot.com/2017/12/candied-grapefruit-peel-dipped-in-dark.html). But those are both for the peel, rather than slices of the whole fruit.

## Ingredients

- 3 large oranges
- 300g sugar and 300ml water
- 1.5 to 3 tsp Angostura bitters, to taste
- dark or white chocolate 

## How to make em

1. **Slice the oranges**. They need to be pretty thin, so that the peel gets cooked enough to make it not bitter. But too thin will mean they'll collapse while cooking. 5mm, perhaps?
2. **Blanch the orange slices in water**. Most of the recipes have a complicated boil-chill-boil cycle that seems tedious. I tried that, and also boiling for 2 minutes then cooling. Both ways came out fine, so I'd go for the simpler option. Have a large pan of boiling water, and make sure it's boiling for the whole time. You'll need to do this in batches.
3. **Make the sugar syrup**. This is pretty simple: stick the sugar and the water in a large saucepan, and heat until the sugar has dissolved completely. Then add half the bitters.
4. **Boil the oranges in the sugar syrup**. Add all the slices - gently! - to the sugar syrup, and leave them there for 40 minutes to 1h30. You want the syrup to be simmering, not boiling violently.
<br> About 30 minutes in, extract a slice, let it cool, and taste it, to decide whether to add the rest of the bitters.
<br> While it's boiling: Don't let it go dry. If it does, add more sugar and water (1g sugar:1ml water) to top it up. Ottelenghi suggests adding a parchment circle on top to keep all the slices submerged, which works pretty well.
5. **It's done when...** well, when the oranges are no longer bitter, and kind of translucent. Recipes suggested about an hour - I would taste them 45 minutes in.
6. **Dry the oranges**. Carefully extract the slices (they can be a bit delicate at this point) and lay them on a drying rack or just on some baking paper.
<br> We put them in the hot-but-turned-off oven for a bit to speed up the drying process, but you need to be careful it's not too hot. They will dry out at room temperature, it just takes longer.
<br> Don't throw away the syrup! We keep it in a jar in the fridge and put it in cocktails and things.
7. **Dip the slices in chocolate**. Really it'd be best to have tempered chocolate, but I'm usually too lazy. Melt 100g of chocolate at a time in a mug (repeat if you run out); dip the slices in so they're half covered, shaking off the excess. Leave them to dry.

And that's it. Yum.
