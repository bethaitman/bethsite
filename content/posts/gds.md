When I was just starting out in tech writing, GDS was just getting going ([origins](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2011/04/28/jfdi-gov-uk/)). I found their work super inspiring - laser-focused on clarity, with great principles to get there.

Let's be honest, I was a massive fangirl. It was one of the proudest moments of my career when they asked me to come in to give a talk on writing for user interfaces.

I come back to the stuff they've shared over and over again. It articulates so well the basic principles of technical writing, and somehow cuts through so much nonsense. They have a gift for slogans as well, which I'm very jealous of.

So I've collected a few favourite bits of their work to share here. It's worth clicking through for the full detail.

[What is content design](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/what-is-content-design):

> Government has a tendency to publish content that is more focused on what it wants to say than what the user needs to know. This makes content difficult to understand and act on.

[Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles):

> Making something look simple is easy. Making something simple to use is much harder - especially when the underlying systems are complex - but that’s what we should be doing. Don’t take “It’s always been that way” for an answer. It’s usually more and harder work to make things simple, but it’s the right thing to do.

[Planning content](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/planning-content):

> All content published on GOV.UK must have a clear user need backed up with evidence.
> 
> Content should be published either:
> 
> * as guidance to help users complete a transaction with government
> * to help users understand what government is doing
> 
> Content that does not do one of these things should not be published on GOV.UK.

Some great stuff on talking about future state:

> [our content] only describes future changes if they are certain or very likely to happen and affect choices a user can make right now, for example if users should apply for something now because a scheme is closing or a service will be down for maintenance.

> Do not publish ‘everything you need to know’ pages for specific audiences as these are never comprehensive and can be hard to navigate.

[Writing for GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk):

> Do not publish everything you can online. Publish only what someone needs to know so they can complete their task. Nothing more.

> People do not usually read text unless they want information. When you write for the web, start with the same question every time: what does the user want to know?

> The main purpose of GOV.UK is to provide information - there’s no excuse for putting unnecessarily complicated writing in the way of people’s understanding.

> Government experts often say that because they’re writing technical or complex content for a specialist audience, they do not need to use plain English. This is wrong.
> 
> Research shows that [higher literacy people prefer plain English](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/02/17/guest-post-clarity-is-king-the-evidence-that-reveals-the-desperate-need-to-re-think-the-way-we-write/) because it allows them to understand the information as quickly as possible.

> FAQs are discouraged because they:
> 
> * duplicate other content on the site
> * cannot be front-loaded (putting the most important words people will search for), which makes usability difficult
> * are usually not frequently asked questions by the public, but important information dumped by the content editor
> * mean that content is not where people expect to find it; it needs to be in context
> * can add to search results with duplicate, competing text
