Sorry for not posting in a while! I’ve been away because it’s been a busy few months. In part because things have changed a bit - I’ve just started a new job working at Ocado Technology (the tech company behind the online retailer). They’ve just created a technical writing team: I’m the latest to join a team of four.

It’s pretty different to my previous job! The tech comms team sits together, so I’ll be spending a lot more time with writers than with dev teams. My commute’s also expanded just a bit - from a 10-minute cycle through fields to 1hr on the train (and some cycling at either end). I’m quite enjoying the train though, as I’ve been getting some quality reading time. 

Anyway, things are starting to settle down now. So I should have some more blogs on the way for you soon :)
