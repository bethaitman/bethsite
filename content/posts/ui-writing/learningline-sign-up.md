Overall, it’s functional but badly written. Problems:

- Useless placeholder text that adds no extra information
- The French quotation marks used to imply forward and backward
- The random links beneath the form are very strange.

    - The second one’s just a link to the site home page, not sure what that’s supposed to help with.
    - Email us does exactly what it says on the tin - opens an email to them - but it’s not at all clear why you’d want to do that.

Even better, if you don’t enter a name in the Real name field, and then hover over the field, you get this gem:
