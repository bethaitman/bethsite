title: "Slack's onboarding"

I’ve been looking at [UserOnboard.com](https://www.useronboard.com/user-onboarding-teardowns/) to get some ideas for welcome pages, and came across this in the Slack onboarding process.

{{< figure src="/images/slack/notify.png" alt="Your browser should now be presenting you with the option to enable notifications, probably at the top or bottom of this window. Click Enable or Allow or Yes or OK or whatever the right button is!" class="image-with-border" >}}

The yellow box, which comes up after you’ve enabled desktop notifications: I think it’s great. It deals with the hard problem of not knowing exactly what your user’s going to be presented with. Instead of giving generic instructions that won’t help much, they’ve made themselves seem more human by admitting their ignorance, and given plenty of casual guidance to help you do the right thing.

The first sentence could be a little shorter - “Your browser should now be showing you the option” - but that’s a tiny nitpick.
