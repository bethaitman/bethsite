One of my co-workers has been using Slack to collaborate with her team, and she loves it, so she sent me some screenshots of the search dialogue.

The greyed-out text in the second screenshot is really useful. It explains very clearly what you need to enter to find what you need, very concisely. The grey colour means it doesn’t get in the way if you’re scanning the options, but it’s obvious as soon as you settle on one.
