Just a quick one today, from ApexSQL Refactor:

{{< figure src="/images/widgets/many.png" alt="Every item has a lightbulb-shaped help widget" class="image-with-border" >}}

There is no way all those options need help widgets. I actually think their option text is reasonably clear, so they can just leave it at that. What more is there to say about, I don’t know, “Add spaces after commas”? 

{{< figure src="/images/widgets/detail.png" alt="Add spaces before commas. Help text - Adds a single space after a comma" class="image-with-border" >}}

Yeah, it’s not adding much.
