I’ve just got back from speaking at [Write the Docs](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/), and I had a fantastic time. Thanks so much to everyone for your kind words about my talk - I’m so chuffed you all liked it. 

If you’re interested, you can take a look at my [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/BethAitman/before-the-docs-writing-for-user-interfaces), or read the [transcript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HTuKl4gSOcqdqYY72MK_frbTpHb73j_WnZN3HExp184/edit) I just typed up of what I could remember of what I said. The talks were filmed, so at some point I’ll be able to show you the video. I’m sort of looking forward to watching it, but sort of nervous too - it was my first real conference talk, and it was a bit of a blur, so I’ve no idea how I came across.

The runaway favourite bit of the talk - according to Twitter anyway - was this example of clearly expressing consequences:

(thanks to [@elitetruong](https://twitter.com/elitetruong) for tweeting it, and [@nickparker](https://twitter.com/nickparker) who I got the image from)

It’s funny, but it also makes a really good point. Clear language is so important if you want people to understand you. It’s the same point being made in this blog post - “use the words normal people would use”.

Anyway, now the conference is done, normal blogging service should resume. I’m always keeping an eye out for UI writing examples, so hopefully I should have more soon to share with you all.
