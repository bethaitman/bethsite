Learning a new language is unreasonably hard.

I live in Zürich, in German-speaking Switzerland, and I work with many people who didn't speak German when they moved here (myself included). Lots of them get frustrated themselves with learning German, feeling like they should be doing better. I think that's partially due to a lack of context, because most skills we have to pick up as adults are _much_ easier to learn.

## The difficulty of language learning

For a lot of common skills, with a bit of effort you can get to an acceptable level quite fast. You can learn to drive a car safely and confidently in a few months. Over the last few years I've learned some new cool things which had a simlar time/effort profile: bouldering, handstands, etc. 

In contrast, language learning is painful. When speaking in my mother tongue, the words I need are on the tip of my tongue; I don't have to think much to speak, maybe occasionally if I care about how it comes across. When reading, I'm used to skimming text and getting the point instantly.

When speaking German, I feel lost for words. I have an idea of what I want to say... but I have to hunt the right word or phrase. I often make grammar mistakes, or speak correctly but weirdly. (Like the difference between saying "I study at night" and "I study in the night" - the latter is not technically ungrammatical, but you sound a bit like a goth monk.)

And as with many 'deep' skills (chess, painting, playing an instrument), the process of learning makes me feel like I am not making progress, so much as discovering more and more of the depth of my own ignorance.

## How to get better at stuff

Now, I am an unreasonably persistent person when it comes to learning new skills. And I don't like being bad at things (blame the fancy private school I went to). But my persistence comes from hope too, because I do believe that we can get better at most things if we want to, if we try in the right way.

About five years ago I read a brilliant book called [Peak](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/psychology/peak/): a study of people who are excellent at stuff, and how they get that way. And the answer is a concept called "deliberate practice". You can apply it to pretty much any skill, and it doesn't mean learning will be easy, but it makes progress possible.

### Core concepts of deliberate practice

I'll go over the ideas briefly, but I have better examples below.

**Goal oriented.** For myself, my goal is (eventually) to be able to work in German. This means I'll need to be able to understand and participate in nuanced conversations, and read complex material. But I also want to be able to chat to friends and strangers I come across.

**Identify what is holding you back right now.** This seems so obvious, but you have to look at where you are at right now, and what is preventing you from making progress to your goal.

**Construct targeted exercises.**

**Have a feedback loop**. For things where there is a 'right' or 'wrong', a 'better' or 'worse', you need to know where you stand, otherwise you can't get better. Sometimes this doesn't apply: for example, when I'm reading, all I want to do is to be able to read faster, so I don't really need a feedback loop to tell me if I did it correctly.

A trap though: too much correction can be discouraging. For me, it helped earlier to focus on "just getting speaking"; I have more motivation to learn grammatical points off-by-heart now that I'm speaking more and enjoying conversations.

### What is not "deliberate"

Not all practice is useful. Just repeating something doesn't mean you'll get better at it. Some forms of unhelpful practice:

**Mindless repetitition.** Learning an instrument, this might be repeating the same tune over and over, without noticing what's wrong and trying to fix your mistakes.

**Staying within the comfort zone.** I did this when I would watch German TV with the subtitles on - I wasn't actually pushing myself to comprehend what was being said.

**Not targeted towards your goals.** Surprise surprise: practice that isn't targeted to your current limitations, won't help you overcome those limitations.

**No feedback.** Eg: if you practise speaking phrases alone in your room, you won't actually know if someone can understand what you said or not.

## What's worked for me

Deliberate practice has been game-changing for me, and I wanted to share a few examples of how I've applied the ideas above.

### The early days: I don't know any words

When I moved to Switzerland, I barely knew a word of German. And in those early days that was my biggest limitation: I just simply had no idea what speech or text was saying. I needed words.

What I did: German flashcards, using [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). It was incredibly boring, but it unlocked the first level of comprehension for me. I also noticed that it combined really well when I was getting more exposure to spoken and written German: if I noticed a word from a flashcard in some text, it stuck much better in my head.

### Being in the world: I don't understand when people speak to me

The flashcards helped a lot with reading text, but it wasn't actually helping me understand what others were saying. In hindsight, this wasn't a surprise. My practice was focused on reading and recognising text, without any aural input. 

What I did: listening to podcasts. [Echo Der Zeit](https://www.srf.ch/audio/echo-der-zeit) is a great news show and they articulate beautifully clearly; [Beziehungskosmos](https://www.beziehungskosmos.com/) is a show about relationships and psychology, and helped me a lot with Swiss German.

Importantly, this needs to be active listening. German is hard for me to take in so I switch off easily; I find that I really need to pay attention to get anything out of this. I have three kind of "levels":

1. Trying to grasp the overall theme of a conversation or podcast. Maybe I couldn't understand the details, but I could work on getting the gist.
2. Pay attention to specific words and phrases. I am trying to actively notice the words I've learned, or notice what grammatical forms the speaker is using, to reinforce correct usage in my head.
3. Trying to notice literally every word, and repeat it to myself in my head. This is _exhausting_, but it's making a big difference to my listening comprehension in the real world.

What didn't work: Passive listening got me nowhere. I also needed this to be 'real' material. Initially I tried listening to language specifically for learners, like "Easy German". I quickly realised that this wasn't going to help, because I wanted to be able to understand real spoken German, not something slowly and carefully constructed for beginners.

### Written material: I can't skim-read, and get stuck

I give up quite quickly when reading long German texts, and I think this is something I can train.

What I did: I now get a daily newsletter about news and events in Zürich ([tsri.ch](https://tsri.ch/)), and I try to read this every morning when I pick up my phone. Right now I'm focusing on noticiing unfamiliar words or forms and trying to guess their meaning, _before_ I look things up. That's because I want to be able to get through life without constantly referencing dictionaries or running text through Google translate.

### Holding conversations: I'm lost for words

By about 2022 I had a decent grounding in German grammar and vocabulary, and my comprehension was okay, but I hated speaking - I was very self-conscious about sounding stupid and making mistakes.

What I did: 1 on 1 conversation lessons with a recommended tutor. We'd go for a walk and talk for an hour week, just about stuff that interested me: politics, philosophy, art, psychology. He would rarely correct me when talking, but he'd take notes, and at the end of the lesson would let me know what areas I should look into, where I was making frequent mistakes. This means I could get better, but I wasn't interrupted while I was getting into the habit of speaking even if I wasn't getting it right.

### Texting and emailing: I don't know what's idiomatic

Now, in 2025, my German is... kind of okay, a solid B2 level. I can hold conversations, deal with most situations in life, I know all the basic grammar. But I know that my speaking is weird: I know lots of words, but I often don't use them right, or I say things a German person would never say. I use a lot of phrases that are just direct translations from English, like "Ich bin interessiert in Politik" rather than "Ich interessiere mich für Politik". In a professional context I think things like this will seem very silly.

What I did: LLMs have been great here. Whenever I write something in German, I'll compose it myself first, then ask ChatGPT to correct it. Specifically I ask for 1) grammatical correction, 2) things that are not idiomatic, and 3) more natural ways to express the same ideas. Early days but I think it's helping.

### The Goethe course

I've also just spent two weeks in Berlin at the Goethe Institut, on an immersive B2 German course. I've already gone on quite a lot, so I'll have to write this up another time. It was great, and my German got a lot better - I can really see the benefits of immersion.

## Where next?

My goals are to be able to work in German, and to feel at home here in Switzerland. Right now I don't feel the need to learn lot more grammar or vocabulary, but to master the basics that I've already acquired. B2 is enough to work in, if you do it right.

Right now, I'm focusing on:

- Slow down, think before I speak
- Memorising more common and correct phrases, so they're at my fingertips in conversations
- Listen and focus when I listen, so I pick up correct speech from natives

I'm in a bit of a motivational dip right now, because I can see how long the road ahead is. But knowing that this is hard, and that I can get out of this with applied effort, keeps my spririts up.
