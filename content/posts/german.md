Learning a new language is unreasonably hard.

I live in Zurich, and I work with many people who didn't speak German when they moved here (myself included). Lots of them struggle, and beat themselves up for finding it so difficult. I think that's partially due to a lack of context, because most skills we have to pick up as adults are _much_ easier to learn.

## The difficulty of language learning

You can learn to drive a car safely and confidently in a few months. Over the last few years I've learned some new cool things which had a simlar profile: bouldering, handstands, poi spinning. For a lot of common skills, with a bit of effort you can get to an acceptable level quite fast.

In contrast, language learning is extremely painful. I'm used to being able to express myself in my mother tongue: when speaking, the words I need are on the tip of my tongue, and the hardest bit is figuring out exactly what I want to mean, or how I want it to come across. When reading, I'm used to skimming text and getting the point instantly.

In German, I'm constantly lost for words. When speaking, I have an idea of what I want to say... and then I have to hunt the right word or phrase to bring it into the world. Then, even if my choice conveys my meaning, it's often not an idiomatic way to say it. I'm easily lost because if I don't catch one word, I can lose the whole thread of a conversation. And reading is still painfully slow.

And as with many 'deep' skills (chess, painting, playing an instrument), the process of learning can feel like you are not making progress, but just discovering more and more of your own ignorance.

## How to get better at stuff

Now, I am an unreasonably persistent person when it comes to learning new skills. And I don't like being bad at things (blame the fancy private school I went to). But my persistence comes from hope too, because I do believe that we can get better at most things if we want to, if we try in the right way.

About five years ago I read a brilliant book called [Peak](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/psychology/peak/), a study of people who are excellent at stuff, and how they get that way. And the answer is a concept called "deliberate practice". It's any idea you can apply to pretty much any skill: and it doesn't mean it will be easy, but it makes progress possible.

### Core concepts of deliberate practice

**Goal oriented.** For myself, my goal is (eventually) to be able to work in German. This means I'll need to be able to understand and participate in nuanced conversations, and read complex material. But I also want to be able to chat to friends and strangers I come across.

**Identify what is holding you back right now.** This seems so obvious, but you look at where you are at right now, and what is the next thing preventing you from making progress to your goal.

**Construct targeted exercises.** This is a tricky bit, and I'll talk about this more below.

**Have a feedback loop**. For things where there is a 'right' or 'wrong', a 'better' or 'worse', you need to know where you stand, otherwise you can't get better. Sometimes this doesn't apply: for example, when I'm reading, all I want to do is to be able to read faster, so I don't really need a feedback loop to tell me if I did it correctly.

I don't think this means feedback is required on everything. Too much correction is discouraging; I think in language learning, it might be better to focus on "just getting speaking", and filling in the accuracy gaps later; for me, I have more motivation to learn grammatical points off-by-heart now I'm speaking more.

### What is not "deliberate"

Importantly, not all practice is useful. Practice just means repeating something; that in itself doesn't mean you'll get better. There are a few kinds of 'useless' practise.

**Mindless repetitition.** If you're learning an instrument, this might be repeating the same tune or scale over and over without noticing what might be wrong and trying to fix your mistakes. My worst example of this was listening to German podcasts in the background while I worked.

**Staying within the comfort zone.** An example might be, watching a German show with the subtitles, and without actually pushing yourself to comprehend what's being said on your own.

**Not targeted towards your goals.** Surprise surprise: practice that isn't targeted to your current limitations, won't help you overcome those limitations.

**No feedback.**

## What's worked for me

This concept has been super useful for me.

### The early days: I don't know any words

### Being in the world: I don't understand when people speak to me

### Written material: I can't skim-read, and get stuck

### Holding conversations: I'm lost for words

### Texting and emailing: I don't know what's idiomatic

## The Goethe course

## Where next?

My goals are to be able to live and work in German, so that I feel at home here. Right now I don't feel the need for a lot more grammar or vocabulary, but to master where I've gotten to. B2 is enough to work in, if you do it right.

- Slow down, think before I speak
- Memorise more common phrases
- Listen and focus when I listen

In a bit of a motivational dip right now. But knowing that this is hard, and that I can get out of this with applied effort, keeps my spririts up.
