Learning a new language is unreasonably hard.

I live in Zurich, and I work with many people who didn't speak German when they moved here (myself included). Lots of them struggle, and beat themselves up for finding it so difficult.

## The difficulty of language learning

I think that's partially due to a lack of context, because most skills are _much_ easier to learn. You can learn to drive a car safely and confidently in a few months, the same with complex physical skills like handstands or bouldering. For a lot of common skills, with a bit of effort you can get to an acceptable level quite fast.

In contrast, language learning is extremely painful. I'm used to being able to express myself in my mother tongue: the words I need are on the tip of my tongue, and the hardest bit is usually figuring out exactly what I want to mean or how I want it to come across. I'm used to skimming text and getting the point instantly.

In German, I'm constantly lost for words. In a conversation, I have an idea of what I want to say... and then I have to hunt the right word or phrase to bring it into the world. Then, even if my choice conveys my meaning, it's often not an idiomatic way to say it. I'm easily lost because if I don't catch one word, I can lose the whole thread of a conversation. And reading is still painfully slow.

And as with many 'deep' skills (chess, painting, playing music), the process of learning can feel like you are not making progress, but just discovering mor eand more of your own ignorance.

## How to get better at stuff

Now, I am an unreasonably persistent person when it comes to learning new skills. And I don't like being bad at things (blame the fancy private school I went to). But my persistence comes from hope too, because I do believe that we can get better at most things if we want to, if we try in the right way.

About five years ago I read a brilliant book called [Peak](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/psychology/peak/), a study of people who are excellent at stuff, and how they get that way. And the answer is a concept called "deliberate practice".

### Core concepts

- Goal oriented
- Identify what is holding you back right now
- Construct exercises targeted at those limitations
- Have a feedback loop to keep you on track.

I don't think this means feedback is required on everything. You have to think about whether accuracy actually matters at this stage; too much correction is discouraging.

## What's worked for me

This concept has been super useful for me.

### The early days: I don't know any words

### Being in the world: I don't understand when people speak to me

### Written material: I can't skim-read, and get stuck

### Holding conversations: I'm lost for words

### Texting and emailing: I don't know what's idiomatic

## The Goethe course

## Where next?

My goals are to be able to live and work in German, so that I feel at home here. Right now I don't feel the need for a lot more grammar or vocabulary, but to master where I've gotten to. B2 is enough to work in, if you do it right.

- Slow down, think before I speak
- Memorise more common phrases
- Listen and focus when I listen

In a bit of a motivational dip right now. But knowing that this is hard, and that I can get out of this with applied effort, keeps my spririts up.
