# Books I like

In no particular order.

* **The Vorkosigan books** by Lois McMaster Bujold
<br> especially **Cetaganda**, **Mirror Dance**, **Memory**, **A Civil Campaign**.
<br> I think Miles is one of my favourite fictional characters of all time.
* **The Lies of Locke Lamora** by Scott Lynch
* **A Place of Greater Safety** by Hilary Mantel
* **Station Eleven** by Emily St John Mandel
* **Prisoners of Geography** by Tim Marshall
* **Daemon Voices** by Philip Pullman
* **Autumn Journal** by Louis MacNeice
<br> *Sleep to the noise of running water,
<br> Tomorrow to be crossed, however deep;
<br> This is no river of the dead or Lethe
<br> Tonight we sleep
<br> On the banks of Rubicon - the die is cast;
<br> There will be time to audit
<br> The accounts later, there will be sunlight later
<br> And the equation will come out at last.*
* **Night Watch** by Terry Pratchett
* **So Good They Can't Ignore You** by Cal Newport
