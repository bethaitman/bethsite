## Poetry

* **Autumn Journal** by Louis MacNeice
<br> *Sleep to the noise of running water,
<br> Tomorrow to be crossed, however deep;
<br> This is no river of the dead or Lethe
<br> Tonight we sleep
<br> On the banks of Rubicon - the die is cast;
<br> There will be time to audit
<br> The accounts later, there will be sunlight later
<br> And the equation will come out at last.*
